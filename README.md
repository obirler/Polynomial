# Polynomial
A library for advanced operations with polynomial expressions. This project is based on Morteza Alikhani's [Polynomial.Net](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/83394/Polynomial-Net) project. It adds so many additional features. It was under [mesnet](https://github.com/obirler/mesnet) but now the project is separated so that it can be used in other projects.
